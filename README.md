# Cardiac-Arrythmia-CNN-Autoencoder

 In this project, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
 are used to predict unnatural and abnormal heartbeats
 through Electrocardiogram (ECG) data, obtained through
 a digital ECG machine’s output. The first approach utilizes
 a standard deep CNN on data obtained from the Beth Israel
 Hospital Arrhythmia Laboratory (MIT-BIH) dataset. The
 second approach uses the PTB Diagnostic ECG Database
 and an Autoencoder-based CNN. The aim is to develop
 a model that effectively utilizes autoencoders for feature
 extraction and convolutional neural networks for the
 classification of ECG signals, enhancing the accuracy of
 cardiac anomaly detection while simultaneously decreasing
 the computational load and training time by reducing the
 dimensionality of the PTB Diagnostic Dataset.
